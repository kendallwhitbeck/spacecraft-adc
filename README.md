ASE 372k - Dr. Renato Zanetti

Kendall Whitbeck - kpw427

Written in MATLAB and simulink.

To run this simulation:
- Aerospace Toolbox is needed.
- Aerospace Blockset is needed.
- Ensure toggles are set to desired conditions (choose `On` for full fidelity).
- Change "Stop Time" (orbit value) if desired (1 orbit = 5760 seconds).
- Click green "run" button at top of screen.
